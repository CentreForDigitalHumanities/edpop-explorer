# EDPOP Explorer documentation

The documentation is created with Sphinx. To build, make sure to have
installed the package with development dependencies (see `README.md`
in root directory) and that your virtual environment is activated,
if you use one. This is required because Sphinx imports the package
to analyze the code. Then run `make html` for HTML output, 
`make latexpdf` for PDF output, or type `make` to see all the other
output options.
