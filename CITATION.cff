  EDPOP Explorer is a Python library and commandline
  application that offers a common interface to multiple
  library catalogues and bibliographical databases, such as
  the Heritage of the Printed Book Database (HPB), the
  Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC), and the
  Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF). It aims to
  normalize the most important information from the metadata
  while keeping all original metadata available. The data
  can be accessed as RDF data or directly from Python
  objects.
