# edpop-explorer
Tool to explore the APIs to be included in the EDPOP VRE

## Usage

To perform a search on a database, give the name of the database followed by
the query you want to perform, such as:

    # hpb gruninger

This will give you the number of results and a summary of the first ten
results. To load more results, use the `next` command:

    # next

The results are numbered. Use the `show` command to see the contents of a
particular record:

    # show 8

To exit, type Ctrl+D or use the `exit` command:

    # exit
